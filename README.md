# task_todo_app

# Core Purpose
Simple yet maybe sophisticated todo app (maybe, for one it'll be work in progress).
Meant for managing your daily chores, maybe even plan your day or in general maintain stability in this raging and chaos inducing world.

<br>
***Task Todo App*** as the name of this repository implies, it's a simple app using Flutter to manage your TODO list.

## Used technologies
This repository is using (or rather will be using, ***work in progress warning***) technologies such as:
- flutter (of course)
- shared_preferences
- bloc
- theme_tailor
- sqflite

That will be it for now, just as warning, those package ***are not yet implemented*** so beware of that. 
This short overview of a README.md page is meant to give a perspective at what I am trying to achieve making this solo project.

## Building the app from source
Be sure to have the same flutter version as this project has: `.flutter`. The best case scenario is to use `fvm`, a [Flutter Version Management](https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started/installation)
(download if you don't have it downloaded on the local machine). After hassling with fvm installation you can build the app!
1. open the project folder and use command `flutter pub get`
2. open android/ios emulator or use real device
3. run `flutter run --debug` or `flutter run` without debug mode.
